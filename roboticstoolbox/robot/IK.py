        ``sol = robot.ikine_LM(T)`` are the joint coordinates (n) corresponding
        to the robot end-effector pose ``T`` which is an ``SE3`` object. This method can
        be used for robots with any number of degrees of freedom. The return
        value ``sol`` is a named tuple with elements:

        ============    ==========  ============================================================
        Element         Type        Description
        ============    ==========  ============================================================
        ``q``           ndarray(n)  joint coordinates in units of radians or metres, or ``None``
        ``success``     bool        whether a solution was found
        ``reason``      str         reason for the failure
        ``iterations``  int         number of iterations
        ``residual``    float       final value of cost function
        ============    ==========  ============================================================

        **Trajectory operation**:

        If ``len(T) > 1`` it is considered to be a trajectory, and the result is
        a list of named tuples such that ``sol[k]`` corresponds to ``T[k]``. The
        initial estimate of q for each time step is taken as the solution from
        the previous time step.

        **Underactuated robots:**

        For the case where the manipulator has fewer than 6 DOF the
        solution space has more dimensions than can be spanned by the
        manipulator joint coordinates.

        In this case we specify the ``mask`` option where the ``mask`` vector
        (6) specifies the Cartesian DOF (in the wrist coordinate frame) that
        will be ignored in reaching a solution.  The mask vector has six
        elements that correspond to translation in X, Y and Z, and rotation
        about X, Y and Z respectively. The value should be 0 (for ignore)
        or 1. The number of non-zero elements must equal the number of
        manipulator DOF.

        For example when using a 3 DOF manipulator tool orientation might
        be unimportant, in which case use the option ``mask=[1 1 1 0 0 0]``.

        **Global search**:

        ``sol = robot.ikine_LM(T, search=True)`` as above but peforms a
        brute-force search with initial conditions chosen randomly from the
        entire configuration space.  If a numerical solution is found from that
        initial condition, it is returned, otherwise another initial condition is
        chosen.

        .. note::

            - Implements a Levenberg-Marquadt variable-step-size solver.
            - The tolerance is computed on the norm of the error between
              current and desired tool pose.  This norm is computed from
              distances and angles without any kind of weighting.
            - The inverse kinematic solution is generally not unique, and
              depends on the initial guess ``q0``.
            - The default value of ``q0`` is zero which is a poor choice for 
              most manipulators since it often corresponds to a
              kinematic singularity.
            - Such a solution is completely general, though much less
              efficient than analytic inverse kinematic solutions derived
              symbolically.
            - This approach allows a solution to be obtained at a singularity,
              but the joint angles within the null space are arbitrarily
              assigned.
            - Joint offsets, if defined, are accounted for in the solution.
            - Joint limits are not considered in this solution.
            - If the search option is used any prismatic joint must have
              joint limits defined.

        For the case where the manipulator has fewer than 6 DOF the
        solution space has more dimensions than can be spanned by the
        manipulator joint coordinates.

        In this case we specify the ``mask`` option where the ``mask`` vector
        (6) specifies the Cartesian DOF (in the wrist coordinate frame) that
        will be ignored in reaching a solution.  The mask vector has six
        elements that correspond to translation in X, Y and Z, and rotation
        about X, Y and Z respectively. The value should be 0 (for ignore)
        or 1. The number of non-zero elements should equal the number of
        manipulator DOF.

        For example when using a 3 DOF manipulator rotation orientation might
        be unimportant in which case use the option: mask = [1 1 1 0 0 0].
