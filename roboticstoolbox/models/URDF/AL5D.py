    Class that imports a Puma 560 URDF model

    ``Puma560()`` is a class which imports a Unimation Puma560 robot definition
    from a URDF file.  The model describes its kinematic and graphical
    characteristics.

    .. runblock:: pycon

        >>> import roboticstoolbox as rtb
        >>> robot = rtb.models.URDF.AL5D()
        >>> print(robot)

    Defined joint configurations are:

    - qz, zero joint angle configuration, 'L' shaped configuration
    - qr, vertical 'READY' configuration
    - qs, arm is stretched out in the x-direction
    - qn, arm is at a nominal non-singular configuration

    .. warning:: This file has been modified so that the zero-angle pose is the
        same as the DH model in the toolbox. ``j3`` rotation is changed from
        -ùúã/2 to ùúã/2.  Dimensions are also slightly different.  Both models
        include the pedestal height.

    .. note:: The original file is from https://github.com/nimasarli/puma560_description/blob/master/urdf/puma560_robot.urdf.xacro
