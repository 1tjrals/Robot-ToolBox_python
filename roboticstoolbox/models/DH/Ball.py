    '''
    reate model of a ball manipulator

    Ball() creates the workspace variable ball which describes the
    kinematic characteristics of a serial link manipulator with 50 joints
    that folds into a ball shape.

    Ball(N) as above but creates a manipulator with N joints.

    Also define the workspace vectors:
    q  joint angle vector for default ball configuration

    calculation of rigid body dynamics, Part 2",
    Int. J. Robotics Research, 18(9), pp 876-892.

    Notes:
    - Unlike most other model scripts this one is actually a function that
    behaves like a script and writes to the global workspace.
